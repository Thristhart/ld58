Ship blockers:

-   Doors facing wrong direction in new rooms
-   Pause some amount when entering a room (maybe: pause sim while transitioning?)
-   Food should only spawn on food spawn locations
-   Food should only spawn up to door requirement count
-   Door requirements should scale with number of rooms
-   Enemies should not spawn based on random poll, but instead spawn a specific number on random (enemyspawn) squares
-   Intro should have instructions/tutorial
-   Game over screen
-   Name (or justify Snakman)
-   Gain flesh over time?

Nice to have:

-   minimap??
